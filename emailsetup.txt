Create a New Gmail Account:

Go to accounts.google.com and sign up for a new Gmail account (e.g., yourprojectemails@gmail.com).
Enable 2-Step Verification (2FA) in your Google Account settings (Security > 2-Step Verification). This is required for app passwords.
Generate an App Password:

In your Google Account settings, go to Security > App passwords.
Select "Mail" as the app and "Other (custom name)" as the device (e.g., name it "MMV Backend").
Google will generate a 16-character password (e.g., abcd efgh ijkl mnop). This is what you'll use as EMAIL_PASSWORD.
Update Your .env File:

Replace the existing values:
Restart your backend server to pick up the changes.
